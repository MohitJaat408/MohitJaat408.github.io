COVID-19 increases black fungus infection risk in India
Written by Minseo Jeong on May 26, 2021 ‚Äî Fact checked by 
Hannah Flynn, MS. A doctor examines someone with mucormycosis 
at a hospital in Ahmedabad in India on May 23, 2021. 
SAM PANTHAKY/Getty Images Mucormycosis, or black fungus, is a
 rare but serious infection that requires medication or removal surgery.
SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 treatment make the immune system 
vulnerable to other infections, including black fungus.
With the rise in black fungus cases, India faces a shortage 
of treatments in the face of two epidemics.
India has been facing high rates of COVID-19, with more than
 27 million confirmed cases since January 2020.
 Also, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently announced 
that the B.1.617 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in India is 
a ‚Äúvariant of global concern.‚Äù

Some scientists believe that severe COVID-19 could potentially 
weaken the body‚Äôs immune response. This could lead to increased
 vulnerability to other infections, especially for people who 
are immunocompromised.

Of particular concern is an infection called mucormycosis, 
commonly referred to as black fungus. In India, 90 people who
 recovered from COVID-19 died from mucormycosis, and there are 
calls by India‚Äôs health authorities to declare a mucormycosis 
epidemic.
